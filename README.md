LMCalculator (Public):
PyGIS method for Landscape Metrics computation (QGIS environment compliant) developed by CNR-IIA Research Institute (contact: mariella.aquilino@cnr.it).

This script is designed to run as a custom Python algorithm in the QGIS environment. It processes a classified raster map in a cartographic coordinate system to compute various landscape metrics such as patch area, perimeter, and count.

Prerequisites:
A classified raster map with appropriate CRS (Coordinate Reference System).
Lecos QGIS plugin for landscape analysis.

Description: 
Vector-based method. 
Automated handling of intermediate outputs in a structured temporary folder.
Calculation of patch-level and grid-level metrics, including area, perimeter, and patch count.
Aggregation of metrics into a single output table for comprehensive analysis.
